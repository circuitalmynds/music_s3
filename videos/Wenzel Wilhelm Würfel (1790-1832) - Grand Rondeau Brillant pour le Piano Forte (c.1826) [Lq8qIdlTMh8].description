(Pla≈à√°ny, nr Kol√≠n, 6 May 1790 - Vienna, 23 March 1832)

Bohemian pianist and composer. He came from a musical family and was pushed towards a career in music. His father was a schoolteacher. He studied piano with his mother. In 1807 he went to Prague where he studied with V√°clav Jan Tom√°≈°ek the style of whom modelled some of his own works. In 1815 he settled in Warsaw where he was appointed a professor at the Warsaw Conservatory and where he soon became a favourite artist in the salon and the concert hall. He toured as a pianist in Poland, Bohemia, Germany and Russia. In 1824 he left Warsaw and returned to Prague where his first opera, R√ºbezahl, was presented at the Estates Theatre on 7 October. From 1826 he held a post of conductor at the K√§rntnertortheater in Vienna. He met Beethoven just before his death in 1827. As a teacher, his most famous pupil is said to be the Polish-French composer Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. After a lung ailment, he died poor and alone, in 1832.
