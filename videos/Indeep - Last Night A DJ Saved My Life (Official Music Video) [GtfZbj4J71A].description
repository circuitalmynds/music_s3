Hailing from New York, the dance-disco outfit Indeep scored a massive hit in 1983 with "Last Night a DJ Saved My Life." Led by songwriter Michael Cleveland, the band issued a full-length album under the same title shortly thereafter, but with the disco movement almost extinct by this time (and with the emergence of such styles as rap), Indeep subsequently had a tough time following up their smash and were delegated to "one-hit wonder" status. The act continued recording into the mid-'80s, and issued a few quickly forgotten albums: When Boys Talk, Buffalo Bill, and The Record Keeps Spinning. But the group's lone hit has become a dancefloor classic over the years, and 1991 saw the release of the 23-track best-of set, The Collection.
