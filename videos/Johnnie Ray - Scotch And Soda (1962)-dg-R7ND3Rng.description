Also a hit for the Kingston Trio, Johnnie's Version was (most likely) recorded at Fine Recording Inc, in February of 1962.  I say this because it was produced by Clyde Otis, and arranged by Belford Hendricks, both of whom worked with Johnnie at Fine for his Liberty sessions.  Really a great rendition, hope you enjoy!
